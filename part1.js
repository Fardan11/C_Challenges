/*Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall.

//s1:

const marksMass = 78;
const marksHeight = 1.69;
const jhonsMass = 92;
const jhonsHeight = 1.95;

const MarkBMI = marksMass / marksHeight ** 2;

console.log(MarkBMI);

const JhonBMI = jhonsMass / jhonsHeight ** 2;

console.log(JhonBMI);

const markHigherBMI = MarkBMI > JhonBMI;

console.log(markHigherBMI);
